This is a simple web app for connecting artists, art models, and event organizers in my local community. 

The initial release will allow me to post my events, and will also allow models to create accounts, search for openings, and sign up for events. General users will be able to browse events and also see (limited) information about the model for that event.

The next phase of development will allow other organizers to create accounts and post their own events, at which point the application will also be able to handle multiple geographic locations.
